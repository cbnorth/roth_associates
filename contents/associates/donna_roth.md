I am humbled to have lived the true American success story. My grandparents arrived through Ellis Island in New York City from Ireland and Italy in the early 1900s.  My father was a mechanic; my mother a hairdresser.  I was the first in my family to obtain a high school diploma of which my parents were extremely proud.  I wanted more; I wanted to be a lawyer.  However, with no money for college, I went first to work, full-time as a secretary, often working three jobs at a time saving every nickel to attend college.  After six years I had saved enough to enroll full-time at the local community college.  I graduated from St. John’s University in May, 1983.
Unable to afford to go directly to law school, I went back to full-time work and a second night job in order to save tuition money for law school.  I completed law school at South Texas College of Law in May 1987, graduating in the top 10 percent of my class.  The oldest of 18 grandchildren, I am the first and only member in my family with a post graduate degree.
I began practicing law in September 1987 with a civil litigation firm in Houston, Texas.  In 1994 I established Roth & Associates.  I have extensive first chair jury trial experience and have settled hundreds of cases through negotiation and mediation during my 28 years of practicing law.  I work hard and represent each client as if they were my only client.  I don’t give up.
I am active in the community giving back to those who are less fortunate.  I volunteer in assisting women who have suffered abuse, provide free legal services to victims of Houston’s hurricanes and floods, and served as chair of the Houston Trial Lawyers Foundation Bayou Ball Gala to benefit the children at Shriners Children’s Hospital.  I serve as a weekly mentor at one of the Houston underprivileged elementary schools organizing a mock trial for the students in “The Case of the Missing Cookies”; I take the fourth grade classes to the state legislature for a look at government in action and organize a holiday party so that each child at the school is assured at least one holiday present, cookies and cupcakes, pizza and soda, and some fun and games during the holiday season.   I actively participate in several professional organizations in an effort to mentor young lawyers and improve the profession including:
-       Houston Trial Lawyers Association, Member
-       Texas Trial Lawyers Association, Member
-       Association of Women Attorneys, Member
-       Mexican American Bar Association, Director 
I am:
-       Board Certified in Personal Injury Trial Law by the State of Texas
-       Licensed and Member of the State Bar of Texas
-       Licensed and Member of the State Bar of New York
-       Member of the American Board of Trial Advocates
-       Moot Court/Mock Trial Judge, South Texas College of Law
 
For 28 years, I have built my reputation and experience by practicing personal injury trial law.  With a strong belief in family I am proud to practice law with my daughter, Andrea Roth, also a South Texas College of Law graduate and my nephew and Seattle Managing Partner, Andrew Voelker.  Backed by a belief that justice and fair play are the fundamental values of the United States and Texas Constitutions, Roth & Associates is here to fight for what is right, and for just and reasonable compensation, for you and your family when another has wrongly caused you injury or damage.
