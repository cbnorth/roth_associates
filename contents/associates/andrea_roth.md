I was born and raised in Houston, Texas. My mom, Donna Roth, was born and raised in New York. My dad, Peter Roth, was born and raised in Switzerland. Education was important in my house while I was growing up. My mom encouraged me as I was growing up that I could be whatever I wanted to be. I dreamed of becoming a pediatric neurosurgeon and helping children who had Cancer like me. When I was younger I was diagnosed with Cancer and had to fight to survive and for me life. But later in life I realized I had a passion for helping people who had injured as a result of someone else’s actions.
 
After graduating High School from Duchesne Academy, I went to Baylor University in Waco, Texas. I received a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science and a minor in Public Relations. I actively participated in different clubs and organizations while at Baylor. I was a member of Kappa Delta, a Panhellenic sorority, and served as the Vice President of Standards. I was also active in Baylor Ambassadors. Every year when the Texas Legislature was in session Baylor Ambassadors would go up to Austin and lobby for the continued funding of the Tuition Equalization Grant.
 
After graduation from Baylor, I followed in my mother’s footsteps and went to South Texas College of Law. I completed my law school education in May 2014.
 
After taking the Texas Bar Exam, I joined Roth & Associates as the newest associate. I have always wanted to practice plaintiff’s personal injury. I believe in helping people who have been injured and need someone to stand up and be there voice. I also believe in the 7th Amendment, the right to a jury trial, and the basic principle that everybody is entitled to their day in Court.
 
I am very active in my community and in giving back to those who are less fortunate. I served on one of the committees for Houston Trial Lawyers Foundation Bayou Ball Gala to benefit the children at Shriners Children’s Hospital. I continue to lobby our representatives in Austin to protect and preserve the 7th Amendment. I served as a weekly mentor at one of Houston’s underprivileged elementary schools organizing a mock trial for the students to perform in “The Case of the Missing Cookies”. I help organize a holiday party so that each child at school is assured at least one holiday present and some fun and games during the holiday season. I actively participate in several professional organizations in an effort to learn more and to gain advice and wisdom from the trailblazers who have gone before me including:
 
-   Houston Trial Lawyers Association, Member
-   Texas Trial Lawyers Association, Member
-   Houston Bar Association, Member
-   Mexican American Bar Association, Member
 
I am:
 
-   Licensed and Member of the State Bar of Texas
-   Licensed and Member U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas
