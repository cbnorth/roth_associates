I am a native Houstonian.  I grew up understanding the importance of education.  My mom encouraged me as I was growing up that I could be whatever I wanted to be.  Initially it was a pediatric neurosurgeon so I could help children who had cancer like me.  When I was 3 years old I was diagnosed with cancer and had to fight to survive.  As I grew I learned I had a passion for helping people who had been injured as a result of someone else’s wrongful acts.

After graduating high school from Duchesne Academy, I attended Baylor University in Waco, Texas. I received my Bachelor of Arts in Political Science with a minor in Public Relations. I actively participated in different clubs and organizations while at Baylor. I was a member of Kappa Delta, a Panhellenic sorority, and served as the Vice President of Standards. I was also active in Baylor Ambassadors. During the Texas Legislative Session Baylor Ambassadors would go up to Austin and lobby for the continued funding of the Tuition Equalization Grant. 

After graduation from Baylor, I followed in my mother’s footsteps and went to South Texas College of Law. I completed my law school education in May, 2014. After passing the Texas Bar Exam in November, 2014, I joined Roth & Associates as the newest associate. I followed my passion in practicing plaintiff’s personal injury trial law. I believe in helping people who have been injured and need someone to stand up and be there voice. I believe in the 7th Amendment, the right to trial by jury, and the basic principle that everybody is entitled to their day in Court. 

I am very active in my community and enjoy giving back to those who are less fortunate. I served on the committee of the Houston Trial Lawyers Foundation, Bayou Ball Gala, benefitting the children at Shriners Children’s Hospital. I continue to lobby our state representatives in Austin to protect and preserve the 7th Amendment. I serve as a weekly mentor at one of Houston’s underprivileged elementary schools organizing a mock trial for the students to perform in “The Case of the Missing Cookies”. I help and participate in a holiday party at the elementary school so that each child at the school is assured at least one holiday present and some fun and games during the holiday season. I actively participate in several professional organizations in an effort to learn more and to gain advice and wisdom from the trailblazers who have come before me including: 

−   Houston Trial Lawyers Association, Board of Directors
−   Texas Trial Lawyers Association, Member
−   Houston Bar Association, Member
−   Mexican American Bar Association, Member

I am: 

−   Licensed and Member of the State Bar of Texas 
−   Licensed and Member of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas
